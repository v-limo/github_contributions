# Github Contributions calendar clone

## 1. What is this?

This project was motivated by [this]("https://www.linkedin.com/posts/javascript-developer_activity-7001843025769308161-qvvS?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop") LinkedIn post by [JavaScript Developer ] ("https://www.linkedin.com/company/javascript-developer")
